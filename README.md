# Flip-n-Find-
This C++ console game lets two players test their memory by flipping cards on a 4x4 grid to find matching pairs. Built with OOP principles, it includes standard, bonus, and penalty cards. Players take turns, score points, and compete to collect the most pairs before the deck runs out.
